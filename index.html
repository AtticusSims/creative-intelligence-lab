                    <p>The Creative Intelligence Lab (CIL) is a research lab in the Department of Arts and Design, Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of Macau. We serve as a hub for investigating the creative potential of artificial intelligence&mdash;bridging traditional artistic practices with emerging technologies to discover new forms of expression.</p>
                    <p>The lab pursues two interconnected goals: to develop practical principles and methodologies for incorporating generative AI into art and design practice and education, and to provide a collaborative space where students and researchers can experiment with cutting-edge AI tools in the pursuit of meaningful creative work.</p>
                    <p>Through practice-based research, international collaboration, and publicly engaged creative output, the lab aims to position the University of Macau as a leader in AI-driven art and design research in the Greater Bay Area and beyond.</p>

                        <p>Celestial Impression is a collaboration between the Creative Intelligence Lab and esteemed Hong Kong ink artist Hung Hoi. Building on the earlier Mars Impression project&mdash;in which Hung Hoi created large-scale ink paintings of the Martian surface after experiencing NASA panoramas in VR&mdash;the Celestial Impression project extends the same art-science methodology to the Moon.</p>
                        <p>The technical team develops two innovative pipelines: multi-image stitching of archival NASA photography combined with AI inpainting to produce seamless 360-degree panoramas, and AI-enhanced generation from low-resolution LROC (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera) data using custom ComfyUI workflows to create high-fidelity lunar surface environments. These VR-ready panoramas allow Hung Hoi to immerse himself in landscapes no human has visited, translating the experience into large-scale ink paintings that bridge millennia of artistic tradition with cutting-edge technology.</p>
